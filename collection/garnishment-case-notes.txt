RE: Garnishment proceedings vs Bradley J Garner by Ewing & Ewing, PC

Facts as I know them:
Original judgement was in 2004 via Estrella Mountain courts. 
Renewal was filed in 2009.
No further renewals were filed.
Judgement lapsed in 2014 after  when no renewal was filed.
We called  Estrella Mountain courts - no longer exists.
We finally got hold of a White Tank Justice Court Clerk. 
They have taken on the cases from Estrella Mountain.
She (clerk) looked up our case #. 
She said that case is so old that all records have been destroyed and purged.
If there had been a renewal, it would still show as active. 
She also did a search by my name in case a new case number had been assigned, with no results.
She said it is no longer possible for ANYONE to take any action on this case, it's too late, they are not able to pursue it. 
She said it is illegal for them to try to garnish your wages.

My credit report shows no public records/judgements and no outstanding debt to Calvary Investments or Household Finance as of 4/26/2018 (represented by Ewing & Ewing) (Experian)

2004 case: CV04-00474RB (renewed 2009, no longer found in system - purged (via White Tank justice court clerk of court))
2011 garnishment judgment: TJ2011-003342
